# Maze Generator and Solver

Generates a maze using a [Recursive backtracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm)
and solves mazes using the [A* Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm). Purposely slowed down to illustrate how the mazes are generated and solved. There is an option to disable this.
